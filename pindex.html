<div id="about">
Hi! I’m <strong>Shaik Mohammed Adil</strong>, currently working on my 
<strong>Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong>. 
During my studies, I’ve developed a solid understanding of areas like signal processing, 
embedded systems, and communication technologies.

I’ve also grown a real passion for <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and 
<strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>. I’m fascinated by how these technologies can 
automate tasks, optimize systems, and help make smarter, data-driven decisions. 
My goal is to build a career in ML because I love turning raw data into insights and creating 
systems that can learn and improve on their own.

I’m excited to combine my ECE foundation with ML skills to design practical, intelligent solutions 
that bring together both hardware and software in meaningful ways.
